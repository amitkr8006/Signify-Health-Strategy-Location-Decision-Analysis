# Signify Health Strategy & Location Decision Analysis (PESTEL + VRIO + CAGE)

This project is a strategic management case analysis of Signify Health in a rapidly evolving healthcare landscape. It combines external macro-environment scanning (PESTEL), competitive advantage evaluation (VRIO), and a structured location decision for a new technology centre using the CAGE framework and Porter’s Diamond model.

## Objectives
- Evaluate how Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, and Legal forces shape Signify Health’s strategic context.
- Identify key sources of competitive advantage and assess whether they are sustainable using VRIO.
- Compare India, Ireland, and Poland as location options for a new technology centre and recommend the most suitable choice.

## Frameworks Used
- PESTEL (macro-environment)
- VRIO (resources/capabilities and sustainability of advantage)
- CAGE (cross-country comparison)
- Porter’s Diamond (location competitiveness and ecosystem readiness)

## Key Insights (Highlights)
- Policy and reimbursement dynamics, labour costs, cybersecurity exposure, and privacy regulation meaningfully influence strategy.
- Competitive advantage is driven by value-based care, analytics-enabled decisioning, and a scalable clinician network, supported by barriers to imitation.
- Ireland is recommended as the strongest location option due to medtech ecosystem alignment, collaboration fit with U.S. operations, and an innovation-friendly environment.

## Outcome
A cohesive strategy narrative with evidence-backed implications and a clear location recommendation, including practical considerations for implementation and risk mitigation.
